# We Can Change People's Behavior
I read a document from a secret agency that describes methods to change people's minds. By understanding psychology and creating a nurturing environment, this process takes time but yields significant results.

# How can we use this to make positive impact instead?
In the coporation environment, nurturing employee in the good behavior will benefit both employeer and employees. This is a win-win game that we all to play. 

> "Human behavior flows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and knowledge." - Plato

If we want to nurture people we have to focus on 3 areas above that Plato was talk about. I notice that in corporation, we have some activities like: tech talk, employee of the years, hackathon, training in house, celebrates important days.

Have you ever curious why they do that? some just do it as other company do and some understand why they do what they do.

I was curious about it, what I concluse about those activities is that they make people have a feeling of:

**Desire**
* What we want?
    * Income
    * Job security
    * Public recognition  

**Emotion**
* How we feel?
    * Safety
    * Meaningful work/connection
    * Sense of belonging 

**Knowledge**
* What we know/understand
    * Acquire knowledge
    * Do thing right  

# Wrongs thing to do

As an organization, change people behevior requires times and commitment from the top. The reasons are clear as there are two complex part of human: rational (knowledge) and irrational (desired, emotion)

The success of this game must be focus on 3 part and involve many stackholders and efforts. Only do one of it or two of it is not enough and fail.

# Start at small step

Now, if you think this is possible and want to figure how to do for your organization? lets begin with super small steps.

The questions to start:
* What is your desired behavior?
* What is the key driver of it?
* What is return of invesment?
* Who will benefits?

I will write what I thinks about behavior changes for my organization in the upcoming article.
