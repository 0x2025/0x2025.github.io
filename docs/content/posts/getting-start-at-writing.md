# Writing is hard
Because it take time to think before writing, I was too lazy to write. However, as more time I spend in my works I always think that one day I will writes my knowledge, experience into a article or blog that I can reuse later.

# There alway starting point
Right, if I'm not start today, then when? maybe tomorrow, or never. So just start by very small steps by writing anything in my mind.

# Start small
Yes, I have no idea this blog would become, I basically just start to setup the blog via Github Pages, use Hogo together super simple template, up and running.
